 * I like this idea a lot - it is quite unique and attacks the interview/coding challenge from a different perspective. I would encourage you to put some thought in how you incentivize people to act as interviewers - the idea of requiring one to act as an interviewer is good, but how can you ensure that the interviewers are not just going through the motions? Consider allowing people to choose what questions they interview for (or even only allowing them to interview for questions that they've answered) so that you can ensure good quality.

 * This seems like a cool project, and definitely useful for CMU students. My one concern is that while the base application seems doable, it might be hard to implement in a very well thought out and usable way. I recommend really mapping out how you want everything to look before starting to build, as this webapp is very UI/UX oriented. Focus on getting the most important part first (the real time code sharing) before worrying about other things to ensure that you have a working app even if you run into issues.

 * I like this project idea. I think the scoping is good. It contains some elements that go above what was taught through Grumblr. It might be a good idea to specify which goals are stretch goals and which are your required goals.
